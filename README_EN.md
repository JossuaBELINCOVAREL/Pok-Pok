## 🎯 General Objective
Create a multiplayer web poker application **without real money**, based on an **Elo rating system** similar to chess.com. The goal is to provide a competitive, fun, and ethical experience focused on progression and performance analysis.

---

## 📌 Step 1 – MVP: Playable Solo Prototype (PoC)

### 🧪 Objective
Create a minimal version to **test the playability** of a Poker (Texas Hold'em) game in solo mode against bots.

### ✅ Key Features
- [x] Variant: **Texas Hold'em No Limit**
- [x] Simple web interface (React or similar)
- [x] Display:
  - Visible cards (player + table)
  - Stack, pot, current bet
- [x] Available actions:
  - Fold / Check / Call / Raise
- [x] Simple bot opponents (basic logic)
- [x] No login required
- [x] No persistence (in-memory state only)
- [x] 1v1 Game (player vs bot)

### 💻 Suggested Technical Stack (PoC)
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js or local mock JSON
- **State**: Zustand, Redux, or local React state
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Netlify

### 🧠 Points to Validate
- Playability and UI clarity
- Turn logic and pot management
- First abstraction layer of the game engine (deck, betting, showdown)

---

## 📌 Step 2 – Elo Ranking Integration

### 🧪 Objective
Introduce the **competitive dimension** with user accounts and an **Elo rating system** updated after each game.

### ✅ Key Features
- [x] Account creation:
  - Login via email or Google (OAuth)
- [x] Elo rating system:
  - Start at 1200
  - Elo adjustment after each match (1v1)
- [x] Match history:
  - Result, date, Elo gained/lost
- [x] Public leaderboard:
  - Top 100 players, search by username
- [x] Simple matchmaking:
  - Player vs player within ±100 Elo range

### 🔢 Elo Rating Rules (suggested)
Elo_new = Elo_current + K * (Result - Expected)
Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((Elo_opponent - Elo_current)/400))
Result = 1 for win, 0 for loss
K = 32 by default, adjustable based on number of games


### 💾 Advanced Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **DB**: PostgreSQL (players, games, Elo)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth / Clerk / Auth0
- **Deployment**: Railway / Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

---

## 📌 Step 3 – Live Multiplayer Version

### 🧪 Objective
Build a **real-time multiplayer system** where players compete at virtual tables with Elo rating adapted to multiplayer.

### ✅ Key Features
- [x] Tables of 2 to 6 players
- [x] WebSockets for real-time sync:
  - Display community cards live
  - Actions visible to all players
- [x] Automated matchmaking:
  - Queue and table assignment
- [x] Turn timer (e.g., 30s)
- [x] Elo adapted for multiplayer format:
  - Ranking based on final position
  - Bonus for top 3, penalty for early knockout
- [x] Private games:
  - Invite link, access code

### 💬 Optional
- In-game chat (temporary or persistent)
- Reporting system
- Competitive seasons

### 🔐 Anti-Cheat (v1)
- Basic multi-account detection
- Block duplicate connections
- IP limitation for private games

### ⚙️ Full Multiplayer Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Zustand (for complex state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Socket.IO
- **DB**: PostgreSQL + Redis for live state
- **Infra**: Docker, Railway, Render, or VPS
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + Logtail / Prometheus + Grafana
